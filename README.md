## Title of the Project
## NephroAlert: AI Kidney disease predictor
Small description about the project like one below
The integration of a chatbot within a hostel booking system, aimed at streamlining the reservation process for students and improving the overall user experience.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Tailored Chatbot for Hostel Booking System is a project designed to integrate a chatbot that leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries to the hostel booking system. Traditional hostel booking processes are often time-consuming and involve manual searches and extensive communication with hostel staff. This project seeks to overcome these challenges by creating an easy-to-use chatbot interface that assists students in addressing inquiries.
